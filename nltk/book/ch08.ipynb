    "- The traditional categories of context-free grammar are atomic symbols. An important motivation for feature structures is to capture fine-grained distinctions that would otherwise require a massive multiplication of atomic categories.\n",
    "- By using variables over feature values, we can express constraints in grammar productions that allow the realization of different feature specifications to be inter-dependent.\n",
    "- Typically we specify fixed values of features at the lexical level and constrain the values of features in phrases to unify with the corresponding values in their children.\n",
    "- Feature values are either atomic or complex. A particular sub-case of atomic value is the Boolean value, represented by convention as [+/- f].\n",
    "- Two features can share a value (either atomic or complex). Structures with shared values are said to be re-entrant. Shared values are represented by numerical indexes (or tags) in AVMs.\n",
    "- A path in a feature structure is a tuple of features corresponding to the labels on a sequence of arcs from the root of the graph representation.\n",
    "- Two paths are equivalent if they share a value.\n",
    "- Feature structures are partially ordered by subsumption. FS0 subsumes FS1 when all the information contained in FS0 is also present in FS1.\n",
    "- The unification of two structures FS0 and FS1, if successful, is the feature structure FS2 that contains the combined information of both FS0 and FS1.\n",
    "- If unification adds information to a path π in FS, then it also adds information to every path π' equivalent to π.\n",
    "- We can use feature structures to build succinct analyses of a wide variety of linguistic phenomena, including verb subcategorization, inversion constructions, unbounded dependency constructions and case government."
