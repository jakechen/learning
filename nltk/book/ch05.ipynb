    "- Words can be grouped into classes, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. These classes are known as lexical categories or parts of speech. Parts of speech are assigned short labels, or tags, such as NN, VB,\n",
    "- The process of automatically assigning parts of speech to words in text is called part-of-speech tagging, POS tagging, or just tagging.\n",
    "- Automatic tagging is an important step in the NLP pipeline, and is useful in a variety of situations including: predicting the behavior of previously unseen words, analyzing word usage in corpora, and text-to-speech systems.\n",
    "- Some linguistic corpora, such as the Brown Corpus, have been POS tagged.\n",
    "- A variety of tagging methods are possible, e.g. default tagger, regular expression tagger, unigram tagger and n-gram taggers. These can be combined using a technique known as backoff.\n",
    "- Taggers can be trained and evaluated using tagged corpora.\n",
    "- Backoff is a method for combining models: when a more specialized model (such as a bigram tagger) cannot assign a tag in a given context, we backoff to a more general model (such as a unigram tagger).\n",
    "- Part-of-speech tagging is an important, early example of a sequence classification task in NLP: a classification decision at any one point in the sequence makes use of words and tags in the local context.\n",
    "- A dictionary is used to map between arbitrary types of information, such as a string and a number: freq['cat'] = 12. We create dictionaries using the brace notation: pos = {}, pos = {'furiously': 'adv', 'ideas': 'n', 'colorless': 'adj'}.\n",
    "- N-gram taggers can be defined for large values of n, but once n is larger than 3 we usually encounter the sparse data problem; even with a large quantity of training data we only see a tiny fraction of possible contexts.\n",
    "- Transformation-based tagging involves learning a series of repair rules of the form \"change tag s to tag t in context c\", where each rule fixes mistakes and possibly introduces a (smaller) number of errors."
